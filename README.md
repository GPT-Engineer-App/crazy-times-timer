# crazy-times-timer

A beautiful website that tells me:

THESE ARE CRAZY TIMES

They mandate extreme intensity.

It's now or never.

Only these things count:

1. Finding great people
2. Giving them freedom to execute and well thoughtout feedback

And has a timer that counts down by second to last of june 31 2024
